## Reflection

- Project idea came from looking at the various portfolio managers(PM) that are for free on the market.<br> Every PM had something that i didnt like. 
  Most where either too complicated or focused on stocks or crypto but not both.<br> 
  I wanted a PM for simple users, without direct connection to the bank or any other platform, where I can save and keep track of my investments.
- Decision to go with a web application for mainly due to me wanting to learn spring boot and web application related tech stack.
